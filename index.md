**My name is Patrick Chiang**
I am a 2nd year Computer Science student in Sixth College. A quote from Steve Jobs that has stuck with me is:
>Everybody should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think.

It has been a while since I have worked with Git so for this Lab I had to search up easy commands such as:
```
git checkout
git add
git commit
```
A few of my hobbies include:
-Video Games
-Violin
-Dance
-Martial Arts

Todo for this year:
- [ ] Be competent with Git
- [ ] Have a project on GitHub
- [ ] Find an internship
- [x] Stay COVID free
